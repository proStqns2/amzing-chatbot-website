# Amzing Chatbot Website

A simple front-end only chatbot demonstration built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project is meant as a starting point ("amzing" = amazing!) for experimenting with chat UI and client-side bot logic.

## Features
- Clean responsive interface
- - Scrollable chat window with distinct user/bot message styles
  - - Basic rule-based responses (placeholder for real NLP/backend)
    - - Easy to extend with your own styles and logic
     
      - ## Getting Started
     
      - Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser:
     
      - ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/proStqns2/amzing-chatbot-website.git
        cd amzing-chatbot-website
        open index.html        # or just double-click the file
        ```

        No build tools required.

        ## File Structure

        - - `style.css` ‚Äì styling for layout and components

            - - Connect to an API-powered backend (e.g., OpenAI, Rasa, Dialogflow)
              - - Persist chat history in localStorage
                - - Add typing indicator and bot ‚Äúthinking‚Äù animation
                  - - Deploy to GitHub Pages
